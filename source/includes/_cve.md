This endpoint retrieves CVE information from NVD and Emerging Threats data. The endpoint relays whether there are known exploits, whether PFPT has observed exploit attempts, the first and last date of the observed exploit attempts and whether the exploit volume is increasing over the last week.  CVEs where we see active exploits should be considered high priority for patching if they are in your environment.


### HTTP Request

`GET https://api.emergingthreats.net/v1/cve/{cve}/`

### Response Parameters

Parameter | Optional? | Description
--------- | --------- | -----------
cve | No | description | No | The vulnerability identification number.
description | No | The description of CVE.
config_operator | No | It coveys the logical relationship of the CPE or child objects. It is part of configurations object containing the CVE applicability statements that convey which product, or products, are associated with the vulnerability according to the NVD analysis

basemetricv3 | Yes | Base metrics for CVSS version 3.1.
    type | Yes | Identifies whether the organization is a primary or secondary source.
    source | Yes | Identifies the organization that provided the metrics information.
    scope | Yes | It is the ability for a vulnerability in one software component to impact resources beyond its means, or privileges.
    version | Yes | Numeric representation of the current CVSS version.
    baseScore | Yes | It reflects the severity of a vulnerability according to its intrinsic characteristics which are constant over time and assumes the reasonable worst case impact across different deployed environments.
    attackVector | Yes | This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. This metric value (and consequently the Base score) will be larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable component.
    baseSeverity | Yes | It is the severity of a vulnerability.
    vectorString | Yes | It is a text representation of a set of CVSS metrics.
    integrityImpact | Yes | It measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information.
    userInteraction | Yes | It defines if the attacker relies on User Interaction by another person to perform actions required to exploit the vulnerability.
    attackComplexity | Yes | It describes the conditions beyond the attackerâ€™s control that must exist in order to exploit the vulnerability. 
    availabilityImpact | Yes | It measures the impact to the availability of the impacted component resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability.
    confidentialityImpact | Yes | It measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability.

    version | Yes | Numeric representation of the current CVSS version
    baseScore | Yes | It reflects the severity of a vulnerability according to its intrinsic characteristics which are constant over time and assumes the reasonable worst case impact across different deployed environments.
    accessVector | Yes | This metric reflects how the vulnerability is exploited.
    vectorString | Yes | It is a text representation of a set of CVSS metrics.
    authentication | Yes |  measures the number of times an attacker must authenticate to a target in order to exploit a vulnerability. This metric does not gauge the strength or complexity of the authentication process, only that an attacker is required to provide credentials before an exploit may occur.
    integrityImpact | Yes | It measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and guaranteed veracity of information.
    accessComplexity | Yes | It measures whether or not extra conditions are required to exploit a vulnerability
    availabilityImpact | Yes | It measures the impact to availability of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Availability refers to the accessibility of information resources.
    confidentialityImpact | Yes | It  measures the impact on confidentiality of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.
    weaknesses | No | Information on specific weaknesses, considered the cause of the vulnerability.
publisheddate | No | The date and time that the CVE was published to the NVD.
lastmodifieddate | No | The date and time that the CVE was last modified,.

An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled. From log4j 2.15.0, this behavior has been disabled by default. From version 2.16.0 (along with 2.12.2, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1), this functionality has been completely removed.
