## Get Malware Family Information 

```shell
curl "https://api.emergingthreats.net/v1/malware/{malware_family}"
  -H "Authorization: SECRETKEY"
```

```python
import requests
api_key = "SECRETKEY"
url = "https://api.emergingthreats.net/v1/malware/{malware_family}"
headers = {'Authorization': f'{api_key}'}
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
print(response.json())
```

> The JSON response should look something like:

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "response": {
        "name": "SocGholish",
        "description": "**SocGholish** is the name given to a malicious HTML injection written in JavaScript..."
